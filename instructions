Use your Lab 08 as starter code - make changes listed below.

This program will store player roster and rating information for a soccer team using structs and functions.

You will need to modify your Lab 08 code to use a struct named PlayerInfo capable of storing the following data for each player:

First name (max 20 chars)
Last name (max 20 chars)
Jersey number
Rating
Your main () function should:

Prompt the user for a number of players
Create an appropriately sized array of player structs
Call the GetPlayerInfo function to prompt for and store struct array data: first and last name, jersey number and rating
GetPlayerInfo takes an array of structs and a size variable
Your switch statement should execute the menu options using the functions listed below -
PrintRoster - non-value returning, takes an array of structs and a size variable.
UpdateRating - non-value returning, takes an array of structs and a size variable
FindAbove - non-value returning, takes an array of structs and a size variable
ReplacePlayer - non-value returning, takes an array of structs and a size variable
For full credit, you must use proper formatting (indentation and whitespace) and include appropriate comments in your code.

You will have limited submissions (10), so be sure to test your menu options with different values before you submit for grading.
You will submit a .c file, rather than using the built-in zyBooks text editor. Once you submit the file, you will be able to see your test results from the autograder.
As a reminder: you are allowed to collaborate with your lab partners on this lab, but you are NOT allowed to use solutions from online sources, from past students, or from previous semesters.
HINT: implement your 'Print roster' menu option first. This will give you the ability to see what data is stored in your arrays, and can help with implementing/troubleshooting the other menu options.
